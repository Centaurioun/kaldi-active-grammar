v0.5.0: User Lexicon! Compilation Optimizations! Better Model!

### Notes

* **User Lexicon**: you can add new words/pronunciations to the model's lexicon to be recognized & used in grammars, and the pronunciations can be either specified explicitly or inferred automatically.
* **Compilation Optimizations**: compilation while loading grammars uses the disk much less, and far fewer passes are made over the graphs, as separate modules have been customized & combined.
* **Better Model**: 50% more training data.

### Artifacts

* **`kaldi_model_zamia`**: [*new model version required!*] a compatible general English Kaldi nnet3 chain model
* **`kaldi-dragonfly-winpython`**: a self-contained, portable, batteries-included (python & libraries & model) distribution of kaldi-active-grammar + dragonfly2
* **`kaldi-dragonfly-winpython-dev`**: [*more recent development version*] a self-contained, portable, batteries-included (python & libraries & model) distribution of kaldi-active-grammar + dragonfly2
