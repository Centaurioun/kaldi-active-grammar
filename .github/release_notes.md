v0.5.0: User Lexicon! Compilation Optimizations! Better Model!

### Notes

* **User Lexicon**: you can add new words/pronunciations to the model's lexicon to be recognized & used in grammars, and the pronunciations can be either specified explicitly or inferred automatically.
* **Compilation Optimizations**: compilation while loading grammars uses the disk much less, and far fewer passes are made over the graphs, as separate modules have been customized & combined.
* **Better Model**: 50% more training data.
